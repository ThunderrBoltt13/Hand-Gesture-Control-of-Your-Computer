# Hand-Gesture-Control-of-Your-Computer
In this project, we have implemented a simple Arduino based hand gesture control where you can control few functions of your web browser like switching between tabs, scrolling up and down in web pages, shift between tasks (applications), play or pause a video and increase or decrease the volume (in VLC Player) with the help of hand gestures.
